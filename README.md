# DemoApp
This app is a throwback to all the things I'm learning during my app dev journey with various basic elements.

## Contains...
>Basic Trivial Authenticator using hardcoded username and password

>Button mapping to image views to change the image onClick

>Guessing the number in a higher/lower game

>Random Name Picker from list which can be altered dynamically

### Note
This is not a project. It only contains the things I've learnt while doing app dev in java
